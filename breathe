There is no such thing as a "real job". All forms of work are real and valid.
%
There is nothing that I need to accomplish to be worthy.
I am already worth.
%
Doing nothing is good for my soul.
%
I am not defined by what I produce.
%
My worth cannot be measured by my paycheck, my job title,
or a list of professional or academic achievements.
%
I will not let society decide what success looks like.
I can define what successful life looks like for me.
%
I am allowed to spend time creating things,
even if they are not beautiful.
